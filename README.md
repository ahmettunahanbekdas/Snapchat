# Snapchat
This application was developed using Firebase. Users can log in to the app and share the photos they want by visiting the gallery on the upload page. Other users can also see these shared posts. If a user shares multiple photos, these pictures are saved in the Firestore database and displayed in a slideshow. The shared photos are automatically deleted 24 hours later.
